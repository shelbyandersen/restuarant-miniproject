# restuarant-miniproject

Views Routes

- home
- reservation form
- reservation views

API Routes

- view tables
- view waitlists
- create reservations
- clear tables

If views return HTML
Build out HTML files

HTML will have:

- Boilerplate
- CSS Library
- jQuery
- <h1>Placeholder with the page title

If I have any routes at all, I need to build:

- Express server (5 basic steps)
- 1. Require express
- 2. Create an instance of express.
- 3. Set the PORT (be sure to include process.env.PORT for deploying to Heroku)
- 4. Listen on the PORT
- 5. Add middleware

Version Control and sharing of files
